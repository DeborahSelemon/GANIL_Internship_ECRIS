# GANIL_Internship_ECRIS
Sample of code used to analyze simulated electron motion in an electron cyclotron resonance ion source during internship at GANIL, Caen, France (under the Erasmus Joint M.Sc Nuclear Physics program) 

This is the sample of the code used in analyzing electron motion in an electron cyclotron ion source with the aim of determining the spatial electron energy distribution function (EEDF) before experiencing collisions by running simulations with the TrapCad code.
 
To get more information on this project or the full codes for all parameters used, contact the authors (Christina Karagianni and Deborah Selemon).
